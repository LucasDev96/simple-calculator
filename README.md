This project is meant to be a relatively simple calculator that will have functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The calculator shouldn't be trying to evaluate more than a single expression at once (if "12  + 3 * 5" was typed it, it would calculate 12 + 3 first as that was the first single expression). I plan on doing all of the extra credit optional parts of this project that The Odin Projects lists. So eventually this will be able to support floating point numbers, have a backspace button, and keyboard support. I'm looking forward to working on this project and the challenges that it prevents, I also think it will prove to be a good opportunity for me to practice using grids in CSS.

Today I've "completed" this simple calculator project. It gave me some good practice with using CSS grid and I feel a lot more comfortalbe using that now, especially with how the template-areas work. This was an interesting project as the guidelines were to only allow one operation to happen at a time which I was able to make happen. There is a side effect with how I limited input from the users to prevent errors though, so with the current implementation you can't input any negative numbers. But I feel overall this project was pretty successful and I had a lot of fun working on it and solving any issues that came up with it.
